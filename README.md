# Plant Disease Model Repository
This will serve as a repository for preserving our work on Plant Disease Detection during junior year of senior high school as a study. The user will upload the image and the web application will read it's symptoms based on trained data.

During this time we mostly used ChatGPT and vibe-coded our way, while reading basic knowledge regarding supervised learning and CNN.

## Future Plans

- Dataset will be made available soon!

- We are now planning to revamp the website as the old website has been lost (didn't export it in the old laptop).


Feel free to utilize it as reference!
